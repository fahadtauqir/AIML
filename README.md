Title: Customer Churn Prediction Model Using RandomForest

Overview:
I am excited to share my latest project where I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn. This project involved the end-to-end process of data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, utilizing a RandomForest Classifierâ€”a robust ensemble learning method suitable for this classification task.

Key Achievements:

Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify missing values, and uncover key patterns that influence customer retention.
Implemented data visualization techniques to elucidate feature distributions and correlations, which informed feature engineering and selection.
Addressed missing data through imputation, and encoded categorical variables to prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms.
Optimized a RandomForest Classifier to predict customer churn with an accuracy of 85%, showcasing my ability to tune complex models to a high degree of performance.
Evaluated the model using metrics such as Accuracy, ROC AUC, and a Confusion Matrix to understand the trade-offs between different types of prediction errors.
Developed a detailed visualization of model outcomes, allowing for easy interpretation of results and insights into the model's decision-making process.
Technical Stack:

Languages & Libraries: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
Tools & Techniques: Machine Learning, Classification, Data Wrangling, Data Visualization
Outcome:
The project has sharpened my skills in predictive analytics and provided valuable insights into customer behavior. The resulting model can be utilized by businesses to identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies, ultimately reducing churn and increasing profitability.

Looking Forward:
I am eager to apply this experience to new challenges and continuously improve the solutions I deliver. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how this project and my skills could align with the needs of your team.
